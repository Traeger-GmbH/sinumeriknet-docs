# SINUMERIK .NET SDK Docs
Here you will find documentation files and code snippets for C# and VB.NET to document the development of SINUMERIK connected applications using our SINUMERIK .NET SDK. The files in this repository are used to share some documentation related files among the different platforms we're using to document our SINUMERIK .NET SDK.

## Code Snippets

The code snippets in this repository are defined as they are and do not (necessarily) implement a whole scenario. Therefore they do not need to be standalone executable without fulfilling additional requirements. However we want to motivate you to use them as reference regarding your own purpose to simplify some common implementation tasks for you.

The whole code snippets listed in this repository are linked into our documentation on [docs.traeger.de](https://docs.traeger.de/en/software/sdk/sinumerik/net)
